# Django Stock Image Bank

This is a simple API to integrate popular stock image services like
.. _Pexels:https://pexels.com and .. _Unsplash:https://unsplash.com to a
Django-enabled project.

This project goal is to maintain the API as simple as possible by using
abstractions that are not tied to any particular service, making its usage as
straighforward as possible.
